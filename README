DESCRIPTION
        Text::CSV provides facilities for the composition and decomposition of
        comma-separated values.  An instance of the Text::CSV class can combine
        fields into a CSV string and parse a CSV string into fields.

        The module accepts either strings or files as input and can utilize any
        user-specified characters as delimiters, separators, and escapes so it is
        perhaps better called ASV (anything separated values) rather than just CSV.
